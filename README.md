# Cricket Stats Web Scraper
Simple web scraper for espncricinfo.com. Scrapes the statsguru pages for
individual player data and stores it in an simple database with a table per
player. Currently only for england players in ODI's

`interactive_plot.py` is an interactive bokeh plot which uses the player data to
visualize comparisons between two players. Want to have this on my webpage really.
